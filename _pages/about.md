I am a 3rd year Computer Science PhD candidate at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) in the [Interactive Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/Interactive) program. I am broadly interested in research at the intersection of race and technology, focusing largely on fairness and accountability in natural language processing (NLP), social computing, and human computer interaction. I am a Ford Predoctoral Fellow and a GEM Fellow.

Currently I am an intern at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) on the [Tech for Justice Team](https://research.ibm.com/topics/responsible-technology). Previously I was a research intern on the algorithm fairness team at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) and an intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley, go Bears!
