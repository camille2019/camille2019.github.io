I'm a 4th year PhD student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) in the [Interactive Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) program. I'm advised by [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) and [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/). My research primarily focuses on understaind and mitigating biases towards underrepresented, indigenous, and colonized dialects and languages in natural language processing (NLP). My primary goal is working towards lingustic technologies that are inclusive and work for social good. Beyond that, I am broadly interested research exploring marginalized groups and their experiences with social media and AI systems. I am a Ford Predoctoral Fellow and a GEM Fellow.

This past summer I was an intern at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) on the [Tech for Justice Team](https://research.ibm.com/topics/responsible-technology). Previously I was a research intern on the algorithm fairness team at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) and an intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley, go Bears!
