Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Associate at [Cornell Tech University](https://tech.cornell.edu/) in [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/) working with [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/). I completed my PhD at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) in the [Interactive Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) program where I was advised by [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) in the [SALT Lab](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html) and [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/) in the [Tandem Lab](https://www.nehakumar.org/people).

My research involves qualitative and quantitative methods to understand and mitigate harms towards underrepresented and low-resource languages and dialects in natural language processing tasks. Beyond that, I am broadly interested in research exploring marginalized groups and their experiences with social media, AI systems, and algorithmic bias. During my PhD, my work was supported by the [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ford-foundation-fellowships), the [GEM Fellowship](https://www.gemfellowship.org/) and the Amazon Consumer Robotics Research Grant. 

My research has recieved awards such as Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW 2023) and Best Student Paper Award from Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO 2021).

Previously I held internship positions at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) on the [Tech for Justice Team](https://research.ibm.com/topics/responsible-technology)the algorithm fairness research team at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) and an intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). Prior to my beginning my PhD I earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley, go Bears!
