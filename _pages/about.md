I'm a 4th year PhD student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) in the [Interactive Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) program. I'm advised by [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) and [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/). My research primarily focuses on understaind and mitigating biases towards underrepresented and low-resource  languages and dialects in natural language processing (NLP). My primary goal is working towards lingustic technologies that are inclusive and work for social good. Beyond that, I am broadly interested research exploring marginalized groups and their experiences with social media and AI systems.

My work is supported by the [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ford-foundation-fellowships) and the [GEM Fellowship](https://www.gemfellowship.org/). My research has recieved awards such as Recognition for Diversity and Inclusion from ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW 2023) and Best Student Paper Award from Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO 2021).

This past summer I was an intern at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) on the [Tech for Justice Team](https://research.ibm.com/topics/responsible-technology). Previously I was a research intern on the algorithm fairness team at [Snap Inc.](https://snap.com/en-US) and an intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). Prior to my beginning my PhD I earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley, go Bears!
